It's often difficult to understand the types of work someone can do without first working with them. This repository is a portfolio of the 'kinds' of work I've done--some projects I simply can't display for various reasons. I hope you enjoy. Please reach out with feedback. 

I primarily work with R for stats/finance work. I'm working on familiarity with Python and will begin commiting Py projects here over time. This will be an attempt to integrate large portions of those overlapping skillsets.

Ryan.
