# Sentiment and Market Outperformance

The goal of this project is to determine if aggregated sentiment on social media and news platforms can serve as a predictor of market outperformance. This can be seen on a historical basis. If tests prove out, then establishing a working algorithmic trading mechanism would be the next step.

Therefore, the steps are as follows:

1.  Aggregate historical market data
2.  Aggregate historical media sentiment training files
3.  determine if sentiment is a statistically significant predictor of price over meaningful time periods (day, week, weeks, month, year)
4.  Create mechanism for live streaming of sentiment data
5.  create algorithm to evaluate sentiment in real or near real time
6.  Predict market returns
7.  place trades by api on TDA or IB platforms

Here's to hoping we all get rich.
